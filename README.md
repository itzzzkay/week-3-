# PROJECT AKAN NAME

## Akan Name Generator

## Description

Akan Name Generator is a web-based application that calculates the day of the week a user was born based on their date of birth and assigns them an Akan name according to their gender. The tradition originates from the Akan clan in Ghana from about 750 AD. Most people know the date of their birth but not the day. This project uses a simple algorithm based off of a formula in order to determine the day and subsequently, the Akan name of the person whose input has been provided to the application.
