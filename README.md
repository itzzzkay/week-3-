# PROJECT AKAN NAME


## DESCRIPTION

Project Akan Name is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. 
This project provides an interactive way to experience this cultural practice. Most people know the date of their birth but not the day. This project uses a simple algorithm 
based off of a formula in order to determine the day and subsequently, the Akan name of the person whose input has been provided to the application.
